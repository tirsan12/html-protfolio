<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an IT graduate from Nepal, currently working as a System Engineer. 
  With a strong academic background in information technology and hands-on 
  professional experience, I am actively involved in system operations, 
  troubleshooting, and maintaining reliable IT environments. I am motivated 
  to continuously improve my technical skills and stay updated with evolving 
  technologies in the IT field.</p>

<p>At 27 years old, I value both professional growth and personal development. 
  I enjoy working in structured and problem-solving–oriented environments, where 
  attention to detail and responsibility are essential. My background and experiences
  have helped me develop adaptability, teamwork, and a disciplined approach to work.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy travelling, watching movies, and exercising. 
  Travelling allows me to experience new cultures and perspectives, while exercise helps 
  me maintain focus and balance. These interests contribute to a well-rounded lifestyle 
  and support my motivation to perform consistently both personally and professionally.</p>
